# Joint Distributions, Covariance, and Correlation

## 1. Why Joint Behavior Matters

### Most Financial Quantities Move Together

So far, we've studied random variables one at a time. But financial assets don't exist in isolation:

- Stocks in the same sector rise and fall together
- Interest rates and bond prices move in opposite directions
- Currencies of trading partners track each other
- Credit spreads widen across issuers during stress

To understand portfolio risk, we must understand how assets move *together*, not just how each moves individually.

### Risk Emerges from Interaction, Not Isolation

Consider two assets, each with 20% volatility. Is a 50-50 portfolio more or less risky than each individual asset?

**It depends entirely on how they move together:**

- If they move in perfect lockstep (correlation = 1): Portfolio volatility = 20%
- If they move independently (correlation = 0): Portfolio volatility = 14.1%
- If they move opposite (correlation = -1): Portfolio volatility = 0%

The risk of a portfolio is not determined by the risks of its components alone. The *interactions* matter just as much, often more.

### Motivation from Portfolios and Diversification

**Diversification** is the only free lunch in finance. By combining assets that don't move perfectly together, you can reduce risk without sacrificing expected return.

But diversification requires understanding joint behavior:
- Which assets provide diversification benefits?
- How much does correlation reduce portfolio variance?
- When does diversification fail (crisis correlations)?

This lesson gives you the tools to answer these questions quantitatively.

## 2. Joint Distributions

### What a Joint Distribution Describes

A **joint distribution** describes the probability behavior of two or more random variables simultaneously.

For random variables $X$ and $Y$:
- It tells us the probability of any combination of values
- It captures how knowing $X$ affects what we expect for $Y$
- It encodes the dependence structure between variables

The joint distribution contains more information than the individual (marginal) distributions. Two pairs of random variables can have identical marginals but completely different joint behavior.

### Discrete Joint Distributions

For discrete random variables $X$ and $Y$, the **joint probability mass function** gives:

$$
p_{X,Y}(x, y) = P(X = x \text{ and } Y = y)
$$

**Properties:**
- $p_{X,Y}(x, y) \geq 0$ for all $x, y$
- $\sum_x \sum_y p_{X,Y}(x, y) = 1$

**Example:** Two correlated binary events.

Let $X$ = 1 if stock A is up, 0 otherwise. Let $Y$ = 1 if stock B is up, 0 otherwise.

Joint PMF:

$p_{X,Y}(0, 0) = 0.15$ (both down)

$p_{X,Y}(0, 1) = 0.20$ (A down, B up)

$p_{X,Y}(1, 0) = 0.15$ (A up, B down)

$p_{X,Y}(1, 1) = 0.50$ (both up)

This tells us more than just knowing each stock is up 65% and 70% of the time.

### Continuous Joint Distributions

For continuous random variables, the **joint probability density function** $f_{X,Y}(x, y)$ satisfies:

$$
P((X, Y) \in A) = \iint_A f_{X,Y}(x, y) \, dx \, dy
$$

**Properties:**
- $f_{X,Y}(x, y) \geq 0$ for all $x, y$
- $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f_{X,Y}(x, y) \, dx \, dy = 1$

The density gives probability per unit area in the $(x, y)$ plane.

### Visual Intuition in Two Dimensions

Think of the joint density as a surface over the $(x, y)$ plane:
- Height represents probability density
- Volume under the surface over any region gives probability
- Contours show combinations of equal likelihood

**Bivariate normal:** The most important joint distribution. Contours are ellipses. The orientation and eccentricity of ellipses reflect correlation.

- Correlation = 0: Circular contours (no preferred direction)
- Positive correlation: Ellipses tilted toward upper-right
- Negative correlation: Ellipses tilted toward upper-left

### Financial Examples: Multi-Asset Returns

**Two stock returns:** $R_A$ and $R_B$ might follow a bivariate normal with means 8% and 10%, volatilities 15% and 20%, and correlation 0.6.

**Stock and bond:** Returns often negatively correlated. Flight to safety during equity selloffs.

**Currency pairs:** EUR/USD and GBP/USD are positively correlated (both against USD). EUR/USD and USD/JPY are negatively correlated.

## 3. Marginal and Conditional Distributions

### Extracting Marginals from Joint Distributions

The **marginal distribution** of $X$ is the distribution of $X$ alone, ignoring $Y$.

**Discrete case:**
$$
p_X(x) = \sum_y p_{X,Y}(x, y)
$$

Sum over all possible values of $Y$.

**Continuous case:**
$$
f_X(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f_{X,Y}(x, y) \, dy
$$

Integrate out $Y$.

**Key insight:** The marginal distributions don't capture the dependence. Many different joint distributions can produce the same marginals.

### Conditional Distributions Given Information

The **conditional distribution** of $Y$ given $X = x$ describes $Y$ when we know $X$'s value.

**Discrete:**
$$
p_{Y|X}(y|x) = \frac{p_{X,Y}(x, y)}{p_X(x)}
$$

**Continuous:**
$$
f_{Y|X}(y|x) = \frac{f_{X,Y}(x, y)}{f_X(x)}
$$

**Financial interpretation:** If the market returns 5% today, what's the distribution of my portfolio's return? This is conditional on market information.

### How Conditioning Changes Dependence Structure

Conditional distributions generally differ from marginal distributions. Knowing $X$ changes what we believe about $Y$.

**Example:** Marginal distribution of stock B returns might be normal with mean 10% and volatility 20%.

But conditional on market being down 10%, the distribution of stock B shifts: mean becomes negative, perhaps -8%, because the stock correlates with the market.

This is why conditional analysis matters for risk:
- Unconditional VaR uses the marginal distribution
- Stress testing uses conditional distributions given adverse scenarios

---

## 4. Independence and Dependence

### Formal Definition of Independence for Random Variables

Random variables $X$ and $Y$ are **independent** if knowing one tells you nothing about the other.

**Equivalent definitions:**

$$
f_{X,Y}(x, y) = f_X(x) \cdot f_Y(y) \quad \text{for all } x, y
$$

The joint density factors into the product of marginals.

$$
f_{Y|X}(y|x) = f_Y(y) \quad \text{for all } x, y
$$

The conditional distribution equals the marginal.

$$
P(X \in A, Y \in B) = P(X \in A) \cdot P(Y \in B) \quad \text{for all sets } A, B
$$

Joint probabilities multiply.

### Why Zero Dependence Is Rare in Markets

Financial assets are almost never independent:

**Common factors:** All stocks are exposed to market risk, interest rates, economic growth.

**Contagion:** Stress in one market spreads to others through investor behavior and funding.

**Arbitrage links:** Related securities (stock vs. options, cash vs. futures) are mechanically linked.

**Information spillovers:** News about one company affects competitors and suppliers.

**Rule:** Never assume independence in finance without extraordinary justification.

### Dependence Beyond Correlation

Dependence can take forms that correlation doesn't capture:

**Tail dependence:** Assets may be uncorrelated in normal times but crash together during crises. This is asymmetric dependence in the tails.

**Nonlinear relationships:** $Y = X^2$ makes $Y$ completely dependent on $X$, but correlation can be zero.

**Regime-dependent correlation:** Correlation might be 0.3 during expansions but 0.8 during recessions.

**Copulas** are tools for modeling dependence structure separately from marginal distributions, but that's an advanced topic.

## 5. Covariance

### Definition and Interpretation

**Covariance** measures how two random variables move together:

$$
\text{Cov}(X, Y) = E[(X - E[X])(Y - E[Y])]
$$

Equivalently:

$$
\text{Cov}(X, Y) = E[XY] - E[X]E[Y]
$$

**Intuition:** Covariance is the expected value of the product of deviations from means.

### Covariance as Joint Variability

When $X$ is above its mean:
- If $Y$ tends to be above its mean too: positive contribution to covariance
- If $Y$ tends to be below its mean: negative contribution

The covariance aggregates these tendencies across all outcomes.

### Positive, Negative, and Zero Covariance

**Positive covariance (Cov(X,Y) > 0):**
- $X$ and $Y$ tend to move in the same direction
- High $X$ associated with high $Y$
- Example: Two tech stocks

**Negative covariance (Cov(X,Y) < 0):**
- $X$ and $Y$ tend to move in opposite directions
- High $X$ associated with low $Y$
- Example: Stock returns and bond returns during flight to safety

**Zero covariance (Cov(X,Y) = 0):**
- No *linear* relationship between $X$ and $Y$
- Does NOT imply independence (nonlinear dependence possible)

### Financial Meaning in Asset Co-Movements

Covariance is central to portfolio theory:

**Portfolio variance:**
$$
\text{Var}(w_1 R_1 + w_2 R_2) = w_1^2 \text{Var}(R_1) + w_2^2 \text{Var}(R_2) + 2w_1 w_2 \text{Cov}(R_1, R_2)
$$

The covariance term determines whether combining assets reduces or amplifies risk.

**Key properties:**

$\text{Cov}(X, X) = \text{Var}(X)$

$\text{Cov}(X, Y) = \text{Cov}(Y, X)$

$\text{Cov}(aX, bY) = ab \cdot \text{Cov}(X, Y)$

$\text{Cov}(X + Z, Y) = \text{Cov}(X, Y) + \text{Cov}(Z, Y)$

---

## 6. Correlation

### Normalized Covariance

**Correlation** is covariance scaled to lie between -1 and 1:

$$
\rho_{X,Y} = \frac{\text{Cov}(X, Y)}{\sigma_X \sigma_Y}
$$

where $\sigma_X$ and $\sigma_Y$ are standard deviations.

**Why normalize?** Covariance depends on the units and scales of $X$ and $Y$. Correlation is dimensionless and comparable across different variable pairs.

### Interpreting Correlation Coefficients

**Correlation = 1:** Perfect positive linear relationship. $Y = a + bX$ with $b > 0$.

**Correlation = -1:** Perfect negative linear relationship. $Y = a + bX$ with $b < 0$.

**Correlation = 0:** No linear relationship. Variables may still be dependent nonlinearly.

**Rough interpretation:**

$|\rho| > 0.7$: Strong linear relationship

$0.3 < |\rho| < 0.7$: Moderate linear relationship

$|\rho| < 0.3$: Weak linear relationship

### Strengths and Limitations

**Strengths:**
- Easy to compute and interpret
- Sufficient for linear relationships
- Central to mean-variance portfolio theory
- Works well for approximately normal data

**Limitations:**

**Only captures linear dependence:** Two variables can have correlation zero but be completely dependent (e.g., $Y = X^2$).

**Sensitive to outliers:** A few extreme observations can dramatically change correlation.

**Not robust to nonlinear transformations:** Correlation between $X$ and $Y$ differs from correlation between $X$ and $\log(Y)$.

**Doesn't capture tail dependence:** Assets can have moderate correlation overall but crash together (high tail dependence).

**Time-varying:** Correlations change across market regimes. Crisis correlations are typically higher than calm-period correlations.

## 7. The Covariance Matrix

### Definition for Multiple Assets

For $n$ random variables $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$, the **covariance matrix** $\Sigma$ is an $n \times n$ matrix where:

$$
\Sigma_{ij} = \text{Cov}(X_i, X_j)
$$

Diagonal entries are variances: $\Sigma_{ii} = \text{Var}(X_i)$

Off-diagonal entries are covariances between different variables.

### Properties

**Symmetric:** $\Sigma_{ij} = \Sigma_{ji}$

**Positive semi-definite:** $w^T \Sigma w \geq 0$ for any weight vector $w$

This means portfolio variance is always non-negative, as it should be.

### Portfolio Variance Formula

For a portfolio with weights $w = (w_1, \ldots, w_n)$:

$$
\text{Var}(R_p) = w^T \Sigma w = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n w_i w_j \Sigma_{ij}
$$

This compact formula shows how all pairwise covariances contribute to portfolio risk.

## 8. Worked Examples

### Example 1: Computing Covariance

Two assets have the following joint distribution of returns:

$P(R_1 = 10\%, R_2 = 15\%) = 0.3$

$P(R_1 = 10\%, R_2 = 5\%) = 0.2$

$P(R_1 = -5\%, R_2 = 15\%) = 0.1$

$P(R_1 = -5\%, R_2 = 5\%) = 0.4$

**Marginal expectations:**

$E[R_1] = 0.10(0.3 + 0.2) + (-0.05)(0.1 + 0.4) = 0.10(0.5) + (-0.05)(0.5) = 0.025 = 2.5\%$

$E[R_2] = 0.15(0.3 + 0.1) + 0.05(0.2 + 0.4) = 0.15(0.4) + 0.05(0.6) = 0.09 = 9\%$

**Expected product:**

$E[R_1 R_2] = (0.10)(0.15)(0.3) + (0.10)(0.05)(0.2) + (-0.05)(0.15)(0.1) + (-0.05)(0.05)(0.4)$

$= 0.0045 + 0.001 - 0.00075 - 0.001 = 0.00375$

**Covariance:**

$\text{Cov}(R_1, R_2) = E[R_1 R_2] - E[R_1]E[R_2] = 0.00375 - (0.025)(0.09) = 0.00375 - 0.00225 = 0.0015$

Positive covariance: the returns tend to move together.

### Example 2: Portfolio Variance with Correlation

Asset A: expected return 8%, volatility 20%

Asset B: expected return 12%, volatility 30%

Correlation: $\rho = 0.4$

Portfolio: 60% in A, 40% in B

**Covariance:**

$\text{Cov}(R_A, R_B) = \rho \cdot \sigma_A \cdot \sigma_B = 0.4 \times 0.20 \times 0.30 = 0.024$

**Portfolio variance:**

$\text{Var}(R_p) = w_A^2 \sigma_A^2 + w_B^2 \sigma_B^2 + 2 w_A w_B \text{Cov}(R_A, R_B)$

$= (0.6)^2(0.20)^2 + (0.4)^2(0.30)^2 + 2(0.6)(0.4)(0.024)$

$= 0.36(0.04) + 0.16(0.09) + 0.0115$

$= 0.0144 + 0.0144 + 0.0115 = 0.0403$

**Portfolio volatility:**

$\sigma_p = \sqrt{0.0403} \approx 0.201 = 20.1\%$

### Example 3: Diversification Benefit

Same assets, but now correlation = 0:

$\text{Var}(R_p) = 0.0144 + 0.0144 + 0 = 0.0288$

$\sigma_p = \sqrt{0.0288} \approx 0.170 = 17.0\%$

Lower correlation reduces portfolio volatility from 20.1% to 17.0%.

If correlation = -0.5:

$\text{Cov}(R_A, R_B) = -0.5 \times 0.20 \times 0.30 = -0.03$

$\text{Var}(R_p) = 0.0144 + 0.0144 + 2(0.6)(0.4)(-0.03) = 0.0288 - 0.0144 = 0.0144$

$\sigma_p = \sqrt{0.0144} = 0.12 = 12\%$

Negative correlation provides even greater diversification.

## 9. Summary

### Key Concepts

**Joint distribution** describes the probability behavior of multiple random variables together.

**Marginal distribution** is the distribution of one variable, integrating out the others.

**Conditional distribution** is the distribution given information about other variables.

**Covariance** measures linear co-movement: $\text{Cov}(X,Y) = E[XY] - E[X]E[Y]$

**Correlation** is standardized covariance: $\rho = \text{Cov}(X,Y) / (\sigma_X \sigma_Y)$

**Covariance matrix** captures all pairwise covariances for multiple variables.

### Key Formulas

**Portfolio variance (two assets):**
$$
\text{Var}(R_p) = w_1^2 \sigma_1^2 + w_2^2 \sigma_2^2 + 2w_1 w_2 \rho \sigma_1 \sigma_2
$$

**Portfolio variance (matrix form):**
$$
\text{Var}(R_p) = w^T \Sigma w
$$

**Covariance from correlation:**
$$
\text{Cov}(X, Y) = \rho_{XY} \sigma_X \sigma_Y
$$

### Key Insights for Quants

1. **Portfolio risk depends on correlations**, not just individual volatilities
2. **Diversification reduces risk** when correlations are less than 1
3. **Correlation only captures linear dependence**, not all dependence
4. **Correlations are unstable**, especially during crises
5. **The covariance matrix** is the central object in portfolio optimization
