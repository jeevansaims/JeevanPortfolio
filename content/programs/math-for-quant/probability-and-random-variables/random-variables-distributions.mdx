# Random Variables and Distributions

## 1. Why Random Variables Matter

### Turning Uncertainty into Numbers

So far, we've worked with events: "stock goes up," "bond defaults," "VIX spikes." But finance deals with *quantities*: returns of 2.3%, prices of 142.50 dollars, losses of 1.2 million dollars.

**Random variables** bridge this gap. They turn abstract outcomes into numbers we can compute with.

### Why Quants Model Outcomes Numerically

Numbers let us:
- Calculate expected profits and losses
- Measure risk with standard deviation and VaR
- Optimize portfolios mathematically
- Price derivatives using expectations
- Backtest strategies with historical data

Without random variables, we couldn't do quantitative finance. We'd be stuck with qualitative statements like "probably profitable" instead of "expected return of 8% with 15% volatility."

### From Events to Measurable Quantities

**Event-based thinking:** "What's the probability the stock goes up?"

**Random variable thinking:** "What's the distribution of the stock's return?"

The second question is richer. It tells us not just whether something happens, but *how much* and *how likely* each amount is.

## 2. What a Random Variable Is

### Definition and Intuition

A **random variable** $X$ is a function that assigns a number to each outcome in the sample space:

$$
X: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}
$$

For every possible outcome $\omega$, the random variable produces a real number $X(\omega)$.

**Intuition:** Think of a random variable as a measurement you make after the random experiment occurs. The experiment determines the outcome; the random variable tells you what number corresponds to that outcome.

### Random Variables as Functions of Outcomes

**Example:** Rolling a die.

Sample space: $\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$

Define random variable $X$ = "payout in dollars" where you win 10 dollars if you roll 6, otherwise 0.

Then:
- $X(1) = 0$, $X(2) = 0$, ..., $X(5) = 0$
- $X(6) = 10$

The random variable converts outcomes into payoffs.

### Discrete vs. Continuous Random Variables

**Discrete:** Takes countable values (finite or countably infinite).

Examples:
- Number of trades executed: 0, 1, 2, 3, ...
- Number of defaults in a portfolio: 0, 1, 2, ..., n
- Binary outcome: 0 or 1

**Continuous:** Takes any value in an interval (uncountably many possibilities).

Examples:
- Stock return: any real number
- Stock price: any positive real number
- Time until default: any positive real number

The distinction matters because we use different mathematical tools for each.

### Financial Examples

**Stock return** (continuous):
$$
R = \frac{S_1 - S_0}{S_0}
$$
This can be any real number (though typically between -1 and some upper bound).

**Portfolio P&L** (continuous):
$$
PnL = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i \cdot S_i \cdot r_i
$$

**Number of winning trades** (discrete):
If you make 100 trades, the number of winners can be 0, 1, 2, ..., or 100.

**Default indicator** (discrete):

$D = 1$ if default occurs, $D = 0$ otherwise.

## 3. Distributions

### What a Distribution Describes

A **probability distribution** completely describes the randomness of a random variable. It tells you:
- What values are possible
- How likely each value (or range of values) is

Two random variables with the same distribution are statistically indistinguishable, even if they represent different real-world quantities.

### Probability Mass Function (PMF)

For **discrete** random variables, the PMF gives the probability of each specific value:

$$
p_X(x) = P(X = x)
$$

**Properties:**
- $p_X(x) \geq 0$ for all $x$
- All probabilities sum to 1: $\sum_x p_X(x) = 1$

**Example:** Fair coin flip where $X = 1$ for heads, $X = 0$ for tails.

$p_X(0) = 0.5$, $p_X(1) = 0.5$

### Probability Density Function (PDF)

For **continuous** random variables, we can't assign probability to individual points (there are infinitely many). Instead, we use a density function $f_X(x)$.

The probability that $X$ falls in an interval is the area under the density curve:

$$
P(a \leq X \leq b) = \int_a^b f_X(x) \, dx
$$

**Properties:**
- $f_X(x) \geq 0$ for all $x$
- $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f_X(x) \, dx = 1$

**Important:** For continuous random variables, $P(X = x) = 0$ for any specific value $x$. Probability is only meaningful for intervals.

### Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)

The CDF works for both discrete and continuous random variables:

$$
F_X(x) = P(X \leq x)
$$

It gives the probability that $X$ is at most $x$.

**Properties:**
- $F_X$ is non-decreasing
- $\lim_{x \to -\infty} F_X(x) = 0$
- $\lim_{x \to \infty} F_X(x) = 1$
- For continuous $X$: $F_X'(x) = f_X(x)$

**Useful identity:**
$$
P(a < X \leq b) = F_X(b) - F_X(a)
$$

### How Distributions Encode Uncertainty

The distribution captures everything probabilistic about a random variable:
- **Center:** Where values tend to cluster
- **Spread:** How variable the outcomes are
- **Shape:** Symmetric? Skewed? Heavy-tailed?

Different financial quantities have characteristic distributions. Understanding these distributions is essential for risk management and pricing.

## 4. Common Distributions in Finance

### Bernoulli Distribution

Models binary outcomes: success (1) or failure (0).

$$
P(X = 1) = p, \quad P(X = 0) = 1 - p
$$

**Financial uses:**
- Default indicator (default vs. no default)
- Trade outcome (win vs. lose)
- Binary event (Fed hikes vs. doesn't hike)

**Key statistics:**
- Mean: $E[X] = p$
- Variance: $\text{Var}(X) = p(1-p)$

### Binomial Distribution

Sum of $n$ independent Bernoulli trials.

$$
P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
$$

**Financial uses:**
- Number of defaults in a portfolio of $n$ independent bonds
- Number of winning trades out of $n$ trades
- Number of days with positive returns in a month

**Key statistics:**
- Mean: $E[X] = np$
- Variance: $\text{Var}(X) = np(1-p)$

### Normal (Gaussian) Distribution

The most important distribution in statistics and finance.

$$
f_X(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left(-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
$$

Notation: $X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$

**Why it appears everywhere:**

The **Central Limit Theorem** says that sums of many independent random variables tend toward normality. Since returns are influenced by many factors, they're often approximately normal.

**Financial uses:**
- Modeling daily returns (approximation)
- Risk calculations (VaR, volatility)
- Option pricing (Black-Scholes assumes log-returns are normal)

**Key statistics:**
- Mean: $\mu$
- Variance: $\sigma^2$
- 68% of values within 1 standard deviation of mean
- 95% within 2 standard deviations
- 99.7% within 3 standard deviations

### Lognormal Distribution

If $\log(X) \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$, then $X$ is lognormal.

**Financial uses:**
- Stock prices (prices are positive, returns are roughly normal)
- Asset values
- Option payoffs

**Why lognormal for prices:**
- Prices can't be negative
- Percentage changes (returns) are roughly normal
- Compounding returns leads to lognormal prices

If $S_t = S_0 e^{r_t}$ where $r_t \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$, then $S_t$ is lognormal.

### When Distributional Assumptions Are Reasonable

**Normal distribution limitations:**
- Real returns have fatter tails than normal (more extreme events)
- Returns often show slight skewness
- Volatility clusters (GARCH effects)

**Rule of thumb:**
- Normal is a good first approximation for many purposes
- For risk management (especially tail risk), be skeptical of normality
- Use empirical distributions or fat-tailed models for critical applications

## 5. Visualizing Distributions

### Histograms and Density Curves

**Histogram:** Bar chart showing frequency of values in bins. Approximates the distribution from data.

**Density curve:** Smooth curve representing the PDF. Shows theoretical distribution.

Comparing histograms to theoretical densities reveals how well a model fits reality.

### Interpreting Skewness and Spread Visually

**Symmetric distribution:** Histogram looks the same on both sides of center. Normal distribution is symmetric.

**Right-skewed (positive skew):** Long tail to the right. Stock returns often show slight negative skew (crashes are larger than rallies).

**Left-skewed (negative skew):** Long tail to the left.

**Wide spread:** Histogram is broad, values vary widely. High volatility.

**Narrow spread:** Histogram is concentrated. Low volatility.

### Empirical vs. Theoretical Distributions

**Empirical distribution:** What we observe in data. Histograms, sample statistics.

**Theoretical distribution:** Mathematical model we assume. Normal, lognormal, etc.

**The gap matters:** If empirical data doesn't match the theoretical model, our calculations may be wrong. Always check model assumptions against data.

## 6. Transformations of Random Variables

### Scaling and Shifting

If $Y = aX + b$ where $a$ and $b$ are constants:

**Mean transforms linearly:**
$$
E[Y] = aE[X] + b
$$

**Variance scales by $a^2$:**
$$
\text{Var}(Y) = a^2 \text{Var}(X)
$$

**Standard deviation scales by $|a|$:**
$$
\sigma_Y = |a| \sigma_X
$$

**Financial application:** If returns have mean 8% and volatility 20%, a 2x levered position has mean 16% and volatility 40%.

### Standardization

To standardize a random variable (convert to mean 0, variance 1):

$$
Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
$$

If $X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$, then $Z \sim N(0, 1)$ (standard normal).

This lets us use standard normal tables for any normal distribution.

### Simple Nonlinear Transformations

**Squaring:** If $X$ can be negative, $X^2$ is always non-negative. Changes the distribution shape.

**Exponential:** If $X$ is normal, $e^X$ is lognormal. This is how we get lognormal prices from normal returns.

**Logarithm:** If $X$ is lognormal, $\log(X)$ is normal. Log-returns convert price levels to returns.

## 7. Key Statistics: Mean, Variance, and Beyond

### Expected Value (Mean)

The expected value is the probability-weighted average:

**Discrete:**
$$
E[X] = \sum_x x \cdot p_X(x)
$$

**Continuous:**
$$
E[X] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x \cdot f_X(x) \, dx
$$

**Financial interpretation:** The long-run average outcome if you repeated the random experiment many times.

### Variance and Standard Deviation

**Variance** measures spread around the mean:

$$
\text{Var}(X) = E[(X - E[X])^2] = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2
$$

**Standard deviation** is the square root of variance:

$$
\sigma_X = \sqrt{\text{Var}(X)}
$$

**Financial interpretation:** Volatility. How much outcomes typically deviate from the average.

### Properties of Expectation

**Linearity (always holds):**
$$
E[aX + bY] = aE[X] + bE[Y]
$$

This works even if $X$ and $Y$ are dependent.

**For independent random variables:**
$$
E[XY] = E[X] \cdot E[Y]
$$

### Properties of Variance

**Scaling:**
$$
\text{Var}(aX) = a^2 \text{Var}(X)
$$

**Sum of independent random variables:**
$$
\text{Var}(X + Y) = \text{Var}(X) + \text{Var}(Y)
$$

**Sum of dependent random variables:**
$$
\text{Var}(X + Y) = \text{Var}(X) + \text{Var}(Y) + 2\text{Cov}(X, Y)
$$

## 8. Worked Examples

### Example 1: Bernoulli Trade Outcome

A trade has 60% chance of making 100 dollars and 40% chance of losing 80 dollars.

Let $X$ = profit. Then:
- $P(X = 100) = 0.6$
- $P(X = -80) = 0.4$

**Expected profit:**
$$
E[X] = 100(0.6) + (-80)(0.4) = 60 - 32 = 28
$$

**Variance:**
$$
E[X^2] = 100^2(0.6) + (-80)^2(0.4) = 6000 + 2560 = 8560
$$
$$
\text{Var}(X) = 8560 - 28^2 = 8560 - 784 = 7776
$$

**Standard deviation:**
$$
\sigma_X = \sqrt{7776} \approx 88.2
$$

### Example 2: Portfolio of Independent Bets

You make 100 independent trades, each with the statistics from Example 1.

**Total P&L:** $S = X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_{100}$

**Expected total:**
$$
E[S] = 100 \times 28 = 2800
$$

**Variance of total (independence):**
$$
\text{Var}(S) = 100 \times 7776 = 777600
$$

**Standard deviation:**
$$
\sigma_S = \sqrt{777600} \approx 882
$$

### Example 3: Standardizing Returns

A stock has mean return $\mu = 0.08$ (8%) and volatility $\sigma = 0.20$ (20%).

What's the probability of a return below -12%?

**Standardize:**
$$
Z = \frac{-0.12 - 0.08}{0.20} = \frac{-0.20}{0.20} = -1.0
$$

**Using standard normal:** $P(Z < -1) \approx 0.159$

About 16% chance of returns below -12%.
