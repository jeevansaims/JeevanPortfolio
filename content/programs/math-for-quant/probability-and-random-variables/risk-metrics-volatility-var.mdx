# Risk Metrics: Volatility and Value at Risk

## 1. Why Risk Metrics Matter

### Risk as Uncertainty in Outcomes

Every financial decision involves uncertainty. When you buy a stock, you don't know if it will go up or down. When you trade a strategy, outcomes vary from day to day.

**Risk** is the possibility that actual outcomes differ from expected outcomes. It's not just about losing money; it's about the unpredictability of results.

Quantifying risk lets us:
- Compare investments on a risk-adjusted basis
- Set appropriate position sizes
- Communicate risk to stakeholders
- Meet regulatory requirements

### Why Expected Return Alone Is Not Enough

Two investments can have the same expected return but vastly different risk profiles:

**Investment A:** Always returns exactly 8%

**Investment B:** Returns 50% half the time, -34% half the time

Both have 8% expected return. But Investment B could wipe out a third of your capital in a bad year. No rational investor treats these as equivalent.

Expected return tells you the center. Risk metrics tell you the spread and the tails.

### How Quants Summarize and Control Risk

Quants use risk metrics to:

**Measure:** Quantify how much uncertainty exists in a portfolio

**Compare:** Evaluate risk-adjusted performance across strategies

**Limit:** Set hard constraints on acceptable risk levels

**Report:** Communicate risk exposure to management, clients, and regulators

The most common metrics are **volatility** (standard deviation), **Value at Risk** (VaR), and **Expected Shortfall** (ES). Each captures different aspects of risk.

## 2. Volatility

### Volatility as Standard Deviation of Returns

**Volatility** is the standard deviation of returns:

$$
\sigma = \sqrt{E[(R - E[R])^2]}
$$

For a sample of historical returns $r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_T$:

$$
\hat{\sigma} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{T-1} \sum_{t=1}^T (r_t - \bar{r})^2}
$$

where $\bar{r}$ is the sample mean return.

### Interpretation as Typical Size of Fluctuations

Volatility measures the typical size of deviations from the mean. If annual volatility is 20%:
- Returns typically fluctuate within roughly 20% of the mean
- About 68% of returns fall within one standard deviation
- About 95% fall within two standard deviations (assuming normality)

**Example:** A stock with 10% expected return and 20% volatility might reasonably return anywhere from -10% to 30% in a typical year (mean plus or minus one standard deviation).

### Annualization Intuition

Volatility scales with the square root of time:

$$
\sigma_{annual} = \sigma_{daily} \times \sqrt{252}
$$

where 252 is the typical number of trading days per year.

**Why square root?** Variance adds over time (for independent returns), so standard deviation grows as square root of time.

**Example:** Daily volatility of 1% becomes annual volatility of roughly 16% (since $\sqrt{252} \approx 15.9$).

**Practical rule:** To convert daily vol to annual, multiply by 16. To convert monthly vol to annual, multiply by $\sqrt{12} \approx 3.5$.

### What Volatility Captures and What It Ignores

**Volatility captures:**
- Overall dispersion of returns
- Typical magnitude of fluctuations
- A symmetric measure of uncertainty

**Volatility ignores:**
- Direction of risk (treats gains and losses equally)
- Tail behavior (extreme events)
- Asymmetry (skewness)
- Time-varying nature (volatility clusters)

**Key limitation:** A 20% gain and a 20% loss contribute equally to volatility. But investors care more about losses.

## 3. Portfolio Volatility

### Combining Asset Risks

Individual asset volatilities don't simply add up. Portfolio volatility depends on how assets move together.

For a two-asset portfolio with weights $w_1$ and $w_2$:

$$
\sigma_p^2 = w_1^2 \sigma_1^2 + w_2^2 \sigma_2^2 + 2w_1 w_2 \rho_{12} \sigma_1 \sigma_2
$$

The correlation term $\rho_{12}$ is crucial. It determines whether combining assets reduces or amplifies risk.

### Role of Correlation and Diversification

**Perfect positive correlation (rho = 1):**

$$
\sigma_p = w_1 \sigma_1 + w_2 \sigma_2
$$

Volatilities add linearly. No diversification benefit.

**Zero correlation (rho = 0):**

$$
\sigma_p = \sqrt{w_1^2 \sigma_1^2 + w_2^2 \sigma_2^2}
$$

Portfolio volatility is less than the weighted average. Diversification reduces risk.

**Perfect negative correlation (rho = -1):**

$$
\sigma_p = |w_1 \sigma_1 - w_2 \sigma_2|
$$

With the right weights, portfolio volatility can be zero. Perfect hedge.

**Key insight:** Diversification works because uncorrelated or negatively correlated assets partially offset each other's fluctuations.

### Why Volatility Can Rise Even When Assets Look Safe Individually

**Crisis correlations:** During market stress, correlations spike. Assets that seemed diversifying suddenly move together. Portfolio volatility increases even if individual volatilities stay constant.

**Example:** In 2008, many "diversified" portfolios saw volatility surge because correlations jumped to near 1 across asset classes.

**Lesson:** Don't trust historical correlations during crises. Stress-test with elevated correlation assumptions.

### Link Back to Covariance and Correlation

Portfolio variance in matrix form:

$$
\sigma_p^2 = w^T \Sigma w
$$

where $\Sigma$ is the covariance matrix.

This formula shows that portfolio risk depends on the entire covariance structure, not just individual variances. The covariance matrix is the central object in portfolio construction and risk management.

## 4. Value at Risk (VaR)

### Definition and Intuition

**Value at Risk (VaR)** answers: What's the worst loss I can expect over a given time horizon at a given confidence level?

More precisely: VaR is the loss level that will not be exceeded with probability $(1 - \alpha)$ over a specified time period.

**Example:** "1-day 95% VaR of 2 million dollars" means: There's a 95% probability that the portfolio won't lose more than 2 million dollars in one day.

### VaR as a Quantile of the Loss Distribution

VaR is the $\alpha$-quantile of the loss distribution. If losses are denoted $L$:

$$
VaR_\alpha = \inf\{l : P(L > l) \leq \alpha\}
$$

**For a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and volatility $\sigma$:**

$$
VaR_{95\%} = -\mu + 1.645 \sigma
$$

$$
VaR_{99\%} = -\mu + 2.326 \sigma
$$

The numbers 1.645 and 2.326 are the 95th and 99th percentiles of the standard normal distribution.

### Interpreting Confidence Levels

**95% VaR:** The loss exceeded only 5% of the time (about 12-13 trading days per year)

**99% VaR:** The loss exceeded only 1% of the time (about 2-3 trading days per year)

Higher confidence means capturing more extreme scenarios, resulting in larger VaR numbers.

**Example:** If 95% VaR is 1 million dollars and 99% VaR is 1.5 million dollars, the extra 4% of confidence (going from 95% to 99%) costs an additional 500,000 dollars in risk capital.

### What VaR Does and Does Not Tell You

**VaR tells you:**
- A threshold loss level at a given confidence
- A single number summarizing downside risk
- A regulatory-recognized risk measure

**VaR does NOT tell you:**
- How bad losses can get beyond VaR
- The expected loss when VaR is breached
- Anything about the shape of the tail

**Critical limitation:** Two portfolios can have identical VaR but very different tail behavior. One might have losses just slightly worse than VaR when breached; another might face catastrophic losses.

---

## 5. Expected Shortfall (Light Intuition)

### Why VaR Is Incomplete

VaR has a fundamental flaw: it tells you nothing about what happens when things go wrong.

**Example:** Two portfolios both have 99% VaR of 10 million dollars. But:
- Portfolio A: When VaR is breached, average loss is 12 million
- Portfolio B: When VaR is breached, average loss is 50 million

VaR treats these identically. That's dangerous.

### Expected Shortfall as Average Tail Loss

**Expected Shortfall (ES)**, also called **Conditional VaR (CVaR)** or **Average VaR**, measures the average loss in the worst $\alpha$% of cases:

$$
ES_\alpha = E[L | L > VaR_\alpha]
$$

This is the expected loss given that you're already in the tail.

**Example:** 99% ES of 15 million dollars means: On the 1% of worst days, you lose 15 million dollars on average.

ES is always greater than or equal to VaR (since it's averaging losses worse than VaR).

### Why Tail Risk Matters in Finance

Financial crises don't happen often, but when they do, they're severe:
- 1987 Black Monday: 20%+ single-day drop
- 2008 Financial Crisis: Months of extreme losses
- 2020 COVID crash: Fastest 30% drop in history

These tail events can wipe out years of profits. Risk management that ignores tails is incomplete.

**Lesson:** VaR answers "how often do I lose big?" ES answers "when I lose big, how bad is it?" Both questions matter.

### Conceptual Comparison with VaR

**VaR:**
- Single percentile of loss distribution
- Easy to interpret and communicate
- Ignores tail severity
- Not subadditive (combining portfolios can increase VaR)

**Expected Shortfall:**
- Average of all losses beyond VaR
- Captures tail severity
- Harder to estimate accurately
- Subadditive (portfolio ES less than or equal to sum of individual ES)

Regulators increasingly require ES for capital calculations because it better captures tail risk.

## 6. Estimating Risk Metrics

### Historical Estimation

**Method:** Use past returns directly.

**For volatility:**
$$
\hat{\sigma} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{T-1} \sum_{t=1}^T (r_t - \bar{r})^2}
$$

**For VaR:** Sort historical returns, find the $\alpha$-th percentile.

**Pros:**
- No distributional assumptions
- Simple to implement
- Captures actual market behavior

**Cons:**
- Assumes past represents future
- Limited by historical sample size
- May miss events that haven't happened yet

### Parametric Intuition

**Method:** Assume returns follow a distribution (often normal), estimate parameters.

**For normal returns with mean $\mu$ and volatility $\sigma$:**

$VaR_{95\%} = -\mu + 1.645\sigma$

$VaR_{99\%} = -\mu + 2.326\sigma$

**Pros:**
- Clean formulas
- Works with limited data
- Easy to update

**Cons:**
- Normal assumption often wrong (fat tails)
- Underestimates tail risk
- Model risk

**Improvement:** Use fat-tailed distributions (Student-t, GARCH) for more realistic tails.

### Monte Carlo Intuition

**Method:** Simulate many scenarios from a model, compute risk metrics from simulated distribution.

**Process:**
1. Specify a model for returns (could include correlations, fat tails, jumps)
2. Generate thousands of simulated return paths
3. Compute portfolio values for each path
4. Calculate VaR/ES from the simulated distribution

**Pros:**
- Flexible, can incorporate complex features
- Handles non-linear instruments (options)
- Can stress-test specific scenarios

**Cons:**
- Computationally intensive
- Results depend on model assumptions
- Requires expertise to implement correctly

## 7. Summary

### Key Concepts

**Volatility** measures the standard deviation of returns, capturing typical fluctuation size.

**Portfolio volatility** depends on correlations, not just individual asset volatilities.

**Value at Risk (VaR)** is the loss threshold at a given confidence level over a time horizon.

**Expected Shortfall (ES)** is the average loss when VaR is breached, capturing tail severity.

### Key Formulas

**Annualized volatility:**
$$
\sigma_{annual} = \sigma_{daily} \times \sqrt{252}
$$

**Portfolio volatility (two assets):**
$$
\sigma_p = \sqrt{w_1^2 \sigma_1^2 + w_2^2 \sigma_2^2 + 2w_1 w_2 \rho \sigma_1 \sigma_2}
$$

**Parametric VaR (normal):**
$$
VaR_{99\%} = -\mu + 2.326\sigma
$$

### Key Insights for Quants

1. **Volatility is the standard risk measure** but ignores tails and asymmetry
2. **Diversification reduces portfolio volatility** when correlations are less than 1
3. **VaR gives a threshold** but not tail severity
4. **Expected Shortfall captures tail risk** better than VaR
5. **All risk metrics have limitations**, use multiple approaches
