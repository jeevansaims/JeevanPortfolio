# Expectation, Variance, and Moments

## 1. Why Expectation and Variance Matter

### Expectation as the Central Quantity in Quant Finance

Almost every quantitative finance calculation involves expected values:

- **Expected return:** What's the average profit from this trade?
- **Expected loss:** What's the average downside in bad scenarios?
- **Fair price:** What should a derivative cost? (The discounted expected payoff)
- **Optimal portfolio:** Which weights maximize expected return?

Expectation gives us a single number summarizing a random variable's "center." Without it, we couldn't compare strategies, price assets, or optimize portfolios.

### Variance as Uncertainty and Risk

Expectation tells you the average. But two investments can have the same expected return with wildly different risk:

- Investment A: Always returns 5%
- Investment B: Returns 25% half the time, -15% half the time

Both have 5% expected return, but B is far riskier. **Variance** captures this difference.

In finance, variance (or its square root, standard deviation) is synonymous with **volatility** and serves as the primary measure of risk.

### Why Most Models Optimize Expectations Under Constraints

The classic portfolio optimization problem:

**Maximize:** Expected return $E[R_p]$

**Subject to:** Variance constraint $\text{Var}(R_p) \leq \sigma^2_{max}$

This mean-variance framework, pioneered by Markowitz, remains foundational. Understanding expectation and variance deeply is essential for anyone building or using such models.

## 2. Expectation of a Random Variable

### Definition for Discrete and Continuous Cases

**Discrete random variable:**

$$
E[X] = \sum_x x \cdot P(X = x)
$$

Sum each possible value times its probability.

**Continuous random variable:**

$$
E[X] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x \cdot f_X(x) \, dx
$$

Integrate each value times its density.

### Expectation as a Weighted Average

Think of expectation as a weighted average where the weights are probabilities.

**Example:** A stock can return -10%, 5%, or 20% with probabilities 0.2, 0.5, and 0.3.

$$
E[R] = (-0.10)(0.2) + (0.05)(0.5) + (0.20)(0.3)
$$
$$
= -0.02 + 0.025 + 0.06 = 0.065 = 6.5\%
$$

The expected return is 6.5%, even though 6.5% isn't a possible outcome.

### Linearity of Expectation

The most important property of expectation:

$$
E[aX + bY] = aE[X] + bE[Y]
$$

This holds **always**, even if $X$ and $Y$ are dependent.

**Why this matters:**

Portfolio return is a linear combination of asset returns:

$$
R_p = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i R_i
$$

Therefore:

$$
E[R_p] = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i E[R_i]
$$

The expected portfolio return is the weighted average of expected asset returns. Simple and powerful.

### Financial Interpretation: Expected Return

When a trader says "this strategy has 8% expected return," they mean:

- If you run this strategy many times (or continuously over time)
- The average realized return converges to 8%
- Individual outcomes vary, but 8% is the center

Expected return is the first thing to estimate when evaluating any investment.

## 3. Variance and Standard Deviation

### Measuring Dispersion Around the Mean

Variance measures how spread out a random variable is around its expected value.

$$
\text{Var}(X) = E[(X - E[X])^2]
$$

This is the expected squared deviation from the mean.

### Alternative Formula

Using linearity of expectation:

$$
\text{Var}(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2
$$

This form is often easier to compute.

### Definition and Intuition

**Why squared deviations?**

- Squaring makes all deviations positive (negative deviations don't cancel positive ones)
- Squaring penalizes large deviations more than small ones
- Mathematical convenience (differentiable, connects to covariance)

**Example calculation:**

Let $X$ take values 2, 4, 6 with equal probability 1/3.

$$
E[X] = \frac{1}{3}(2 + 4 + 6) = 4
$$

$$
E[X^2] = \frac{1}{3}(4 + 16 + 36) = \frac{56}{3} \approx 18.67
$$

$$
\text{Var}(X) = 18.67 - 16 = 2.67
$$

### Why Variance Penalizes Large Deviations

Because we square deviations:
- A deviation of 1 contributes $1^2 = 1$
- A deviation of 2 contributes $2^2 = 4$
- A deviation of 3 contributes $3^2 = 9$

Large deviations dominate the variance calculation. This matches financial intuition: a few extreme losses matter more than many small fluctuations.

### Standard Deviation as Volatility

**Standard deviation** is the square root of variance:

$$
\sigma_X = \sqrt{\text{Var}(X)}
$$

**Why use standard deviation?**
- Same units as the original variable (if $X$ is in percent, $\sigma_X$ is in percent)
- More interpretable than variance
- Connects to the normal distribution (68-95-99.7 rule)

In finance, standard deviation of returns is called **volatility**. A stock with 20% annual volatility has standard deviation 0.20 in its annual returns.

## 4. Properties of Expectation and Variance

### Scaling and Shifting

For constants $a$ and $b$:

**Expectation:**
$$
E[aX + b] = aE[X] + b
$$

**Variance:**
$$
\text{Var}(aX + b) = a^2 \text{Var}(X)
$$

Note: Adding a constant shifts the distribution but doesn't change its spread. Multiplying scales both center and spread.

**Financial application:** A 2x levered position doubles expected return AND doubles volatility (so variance quadruples).

### Variance of Sums

**Independent random variables:**
$$
\text{Var}(X + Y) = \text{Var}(X) + \text{Var}(Y)
$$

Variances add when variables are independent.

**Dependent random variables:**
$$
\text{Var}(X + Y) = \text{Var}(X) + \text{Var}(Y) + 2\text{Cov}(X, Y)
$$

Covariance appears when variables are correlated.

### Why Diversification Reduces Variance

Consider a portfolio of $n$ identical, independent assets, each with variance $\sigma^2$.

Equal weights: $w_i = 1/n$

Portfolio variance:
$$
\text{Var}(R_p) = \sum_{i=1}^n \left(\frac{1}{n}\right)^2 \sigma^2 = \frac{n \sigma^2}{n^2} = \frac{\sigma^2}{n}
$$

As $n$ increases, portfolio variance decreases. This is diversification.

**The catch:** Real assets aren't independent. Positive correlations limit diversification benefits. When correlations spike (market crashes), diversification fails precisely when you need it most.

## 5. Higher Moments

### What Are Moments?

The $k$-th moment of $X$ is $E[X^k]$.

The $k$-th central moment is $E[(X - E[X])^k]$.

**Key moments:**
- 1st moment: Mean (center)
- 2nd central moment: Variance (spread)
- 3rd central moment: Related to skewness (asymmetry)
- 4th central moment: Related to kurtosis (tail weight)

### Skewness: Asymmetry of the Distribution

**Skewness** measures how asymmetric a distribution is:

$$
\text{Skewness} = \frac{E[(X - \mu)^3]}{\sigma^3}
$$

Dividing by $\sigma^3$ makes it dimensionless.

**Interpretation:**
- Skewness = 0: Symmetric distribution
- Skewness > 0: Right tail is longer (positive skew)
- Skewness < 0: Left tail is longer (negative skew)

**Financial returns typically have negative skew:** Large drops are more common than large rallies of the same size. Crashes are real; the market doesn't crash upward.

### Kurtosis: Tail Heaviness

**Kurtosis** measures how heavy the tails are:

$$
\text{Kurtosis} = \frac{E[(X - \mu)^4]}{\sigma^4}
$$

**Excess kurtosis** = Kurtosis - 3 (since normal distribution has kurtosis 3)

**Interpretation:**
- Excess kurtosis = 0: Normal-like tails
- Excess kurtosis > 0: Heavier tails than normal (more extreme events)
- Excess kurtosis < 0: Lighter tails than normal (rare)

**Financial returns have positive excess kurtosis:** Extreme events (both positive and negative) happen more often than a normal distribution predicts. This is why risk models based on normality underestimate tail risk.

### Why Higher Moments Matter in Financial Returns

**The problem with mean-variance:**

Mean and variance don't fully describe return distributions. Two distributions can have identical mean and variance but very different:
- Probability of extreme losses (tail risk)
- Asymmetry between gains and losses

**Practical implications:**
- VaR and Expected Shortfall depend on tail behavior, not just variance
- Option prices embed information about skewness (implied volatility skew)
- Risk management must account for fat tails (kurtosis)

## 6. Moments and Distribution Shape

### How Moments Summarize Distributions

Each moment captures one aspect of the distribution's shape:

**Mean:** Center, location

**Variance:** Spread, volatility

**Skewness:** Asymmetry, direction of tail

**Kurtosis:** Tail weight, extreme event frequency

Together, the first four moments give a reasonable picture of most financial distributions.

### What Moments Capture and What They Miss

**Moments capture:**
- Overall location and scale
- Gross asymmetry
- General tail behavior

**Moments miss:**
- Fine structure of the distribution
- Multiple modes (bimodal distributions)
- Specific tail probabilities
- Dependence structure (for multivariate cases)

### When Moments Are Sufficient

**Normal distribution:** Completely specified by mean and variance. Higher moments are determined by these two.

**General distributions:** Need more than two moments, but the first four often suffice for practical purposes.

### When Moments Aren't Sufficient

**Extreme value analysis:** Need to model the tail specifically, not just summarize it with kurtosis.

**Option pricing:** The entire distribution matters, not just moments. This is why we use full models (Black-Scholes, stochastic volatility) rather than moment-based approximations.

**Regime-switching:** Distributions that change character over time can't be summarized by fixed moments.

## 7. Worked Examples

### Example 1: Computing Variance

A trade returns 15% with probability 0.6 and -10% with probability 0.4.

**Expected return:**
$$
E[R] = 0.15(0.6) + (-0.10)(0.4) = 0.09 - 0.04 = 0.05 = 5\%
$$

**Expected squared return:**
$$
E[R^2] = (0.15)^2(0.6) + (-0.10)^2(0.4) = 0.0135 + 0.004 = 0.0175
$$

**Variance:**
$$
\text{Var}(R) = 0.0175 - (0.05)^2 = 0.0175 - 0.0025 = 0.015
$$

**Standard deviation:**
$$
\sigma_R = \sqrt{0.015} \approx 0.122 = 12.2\%
$$

### Example 2: Portfolio Variance with Independence

Two assets, each with expected return 8% and volatility 20%, are uncorrelated.

Equal-weighted portfolio: $w_1 = w_2 = 0.5$

**Portfolio expected return:**
$$
E[R_p] = 0.5(0.08) + 0.5(0.08) = 0.08 = 8\%
$$

**Portfolio variance (independent assets):**
$$
\text{Var}(R_p) = (0.5)^2(0.20)^2 + (0.5)^2(0.20)^2 = 0.01 + 0.01 = 0.02
$$

**Portfolio volatility:**
$$
\sigma_p = \sqrt{0.02} \approx 0.141 = 14.1\%
$$

Same expected return (8%), but lower volatility (14.1% vs 20%). This is diversification.

### Example 3: Effect of Correlation

Same setup, but now correlation is $\rho = 0.6$.

$$
\text{Cov}(R_1, R_2) = \rho \cdot \sigma_1 \cdot \sigma_2 = 0.6(0.20)(0.20) = 0.024
$$

**Portfolio variance:**
$$
\text{Var}(R_p) = 0.02 + 2(0.5)(0.5)(0.024) = 0.02 + 0.012 = 0.032
$$

**Portfolio volatility:**
$$
\sigma_p = \sqrt{0.032} \approx 0.179 = 17.9\%
$$

Correlation reduces diversification benefit. Volatility is now 17.9% instead of 14.1%.

## 8. Summary

### Key Concepts

**Expectation** is the probability-weighted average, the center of a distribution.

**Variance** measures spread around the mean; standard deviation is its square root (volatility).

**Skewness** measures asymmetry; financial returns are typically negatively skewed.

**Kurtosis** measures tail weight; financial returns have excess kurtosis (fat tails).

### Key Formulas

**Expectation:**
$$
E[X] = \sum_x x \cdot P(X = x) \quad \text{or} \quad \int x \cdot f(x) \, dx
$$

**Variance:**
$$
\text{Var}(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2
$$

**Standard deviation:**
$$
\sigma = \sqrt{\text{Var}(X)}
$$

**Linearity of expectation:**
$$
E[aX + bY] = aE[X] + bE[Y]
$$

**Variance scaling:**
$$
\text{Var}(aX) = a^2 \text{Var}(X)
$$

### Key Insights for Quants

1. **Expectation and variance are the foundation** of portfolio theory
2. **Linearity of expectation** makes portfolio math tractable
3. **Diversification reduces variance** only when correlations are imperfect
4. **Skewness and kurtosis matter** for tail risk and option pricing
5. **Normal distribution assumptions underestimate** extreme events
