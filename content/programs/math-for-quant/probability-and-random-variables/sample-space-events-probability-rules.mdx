# Sample Space, Events, and Probability Rules

## 1. Why Probability Matters for Quants

Finance is fundamentally about **uncertainty**. Every decision a quant makes involves outcomes that cannot be known in advance:

- Will this stock go up or down tomorrow?
- What will the portfolio return be next month?
- Will this counterparty default?
- How large could our losses be in a market crash?

**Probability is the mathematical framework for reasoning about uncertainty.**

### Probability as a Modeling Framework, Not Truth

A critical insight: probabilities are **models**, not reality. When we say "there's a 60% chance the stock goes up," we're not claiming to know the future. We're building a mathematical model that helps us:

- Make consistent decisions under uncertainty
- Price derivatives and contingent claims
- Manage risk systematically
- Quantify our beliefs about future outcomes

**The goal isn't to predict the future perfectly. It's to make better decisions than we would without a probabilistic framework.**

### From Deterministic to Stochastic

In deterministic math, inputs produce fixed outputs: $f(x) = x^2$ always gives the same result for the same $x$.

In finance, the same "input" (holding a stock) produces different outputs (returns) depending on which state of the world occurs. This is **stochastic** (random) behavior.

Probability theory gives us the tools to work with stochastic systems systematically.

## 2. Random Experiments and Sample Space

### What is a Random Experiment?

A **random experiment** is any process whose outcome cannot be predicted with certainty, but whose possible outcomes are known.

**Examples in finance:**

- Observing tomorrow's stock return
- Recording whether a bond defaults within a year
- Measuring the VIX at market close
- Counting how many trades execute in an hour

### The Sample Space

The **sample space** $\Omega$ (omega) is the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment.

**Key principle:** Before assigning probabilities, you must define what can possibly happen.

### Discrete Sample Spaces

When outcomes are countable (finite or countably infinite):

**Coin flip:**
$$
\Omega = \{H, T\}
$$

**Single die roll:**
$$
\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}
$$

**Stock direction tomorrow:**
$$
\Omega = \{\text{Up}, \text{Down}, \text{Flat}\}
$$

**Number of defaults in a portfolio:**
$$
\Omega = \{0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots, n\}
$$

### Continuous Sample Spaces

When outcomes can take any value in an interval:

**Stock return tomorrow:**
$$
\Omega = \mathbb{R} = (-\infty, \infty)
$$

**Stock price (must be positive):**
$$
\Omega = \mathbb{R}^+ = (0, \infty)
$$

**Portfolio volatility:**
$$
\Omega = [0, \infty)
$$

### Financial Examples in Detail

**Example 1: Daily Return**

For a single stock's daily return:
$$
\Omega = \mathbb{R}
$$

An outcome $\omega \in \Omega$ might be $\omega = 0.023$ (a 2.3% return).

**Example 2: Credit Event**

For whether a corporate bond defaults this year:
$$
\Omega = \{\text{Default}, \text{No Default}\}
$$

**Example 3: Joint Returns**

For returns of two assets:
$$
\Omega = \mathbb{R}^2 = \{(r_1, r_2) : r_1, r_2 \in \mathbb{R}\}
$$

An outcome might be $\omega = (0.02, -0.01)$: asset 1 up 2%, asset 2 down 1%.

## 3. Events

### Events as Subsets

An **event** is a subset of the sample space, a collection of outcomes we're interested in.

$$
A \subseteq \Omega
$$

**Why subsets?** We often don't care about exact outcomes. We care about whether outcomes fall into certain categories.

### Simple vs. Compound Events

**Simple event:** Contains a single outcome, like "the stock returns exactly 5%."

**Compound event:** Contains multiple outcomes, like "the stock returns more than 5%." This includes all returns above 5%.

In continuous sample spaces, compound events are typically the only ones with nonzero probability.

### Financial Event Examples

**The stock goes up:**
$$
A = \{\omega \in \Omega : r(\omega) > 0\}
$$

**The portfolio loses more than 10%:**
$$
B = \{\omega \in \Omega : R_p(\omega) < -0.10\}
$$

**At least one of three bonds defaults:**
$$
C = \{\omega : \text{one or more defaults occur}\}
$$

**VIX exceeds 30:**
$$
D = \{\omega : \text{VIX}(\omega) > 30\}
$$

### What It Means for an Event to Occur

After the random experiment is performed, we observe some outcome $\omega^* \in \Omega$.

**Event $A$ occurs** if and only if $\omega^* \in A$.

If today's return is $\omega^* = 0.03$ (3%), then:
- Event "stock goes up" ($r > 0$) **occurred**
- Event "stock returns more than 5%" ($r > 0.05$) **did not occur**

## 4. Assigning Probabilities

### Probability as a Number

A **probability** $P(A)$ assigns a number between 0 and 1 to each event:

$$
P: \text{Events} \to [0, 1]
$$

**Interpretation:**
- $P(A) = 0$: Event $A$ is impossible
- $P(A) = 1$: Event $A$ is certain
- $P(A) = 0.7$: Event $A$ occurs in 70% of scenarios (roughly)

### The Three Axioms of Probability

Every valid probability assignment must satisfy:

**Axiom 1: Non-negativity**
$$
P(A) \geq 0 \text{ for all events } A
$$

**Axiom 2: Normalization**
$$
P(\Omega) = 1
$$
Something must happen.

**Axiom 3: Additivity**

For **disjoint** events (events that cannot both occur):
$$
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) \text{ when } A \cap B = \emptyset
$$

These three axioms are the foundation. Everything else in probability theory follows from them.

### Uniform Probability

When all outcomes are equally likely:
$$
P(A) = \frac{|A|}{|\Omega|} = \frac{\text{number of outcomes in } A}{\text{total number of outcomes}}
$$

**Example:** Fair die roll
$$
P(\text{roll a 6}) = \frac{1}{6}
$$
$$
P(\text{roll even}) = \frac{|\{2, 4, 6\}|}{6} = \frac{3}{6} = 0.5
$$

### Subjective vs. Empirical Probabilities

**Empirical (frequentist):** Based on observed frequencies.

"This stock has gone up on 53% of trading days historically, so $P(\text{up}) \approx 0.53$."

**Subjective (Bayesian):** Based on beliefs and information.

"Given the earnings report, I believe there's a 70% chance the stock goes up."

Both approaches are valid. Quants often combine historical data with forward-looking views.

## 5. Probability Rules

### The Complement Rule

The complement $A^c$ contains all outcomes NOT in $A$:
$$
A^c = \{\omega \in \Omega : \omega \notin A\}
$$

**Probability rule:**
$$
P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)
$$

**Example:** If $P(\text{stock up}) = 0.55$, then $P(\text{stock not up}) = 0.45$.

**Useful trick:** Sometimes it's easier to calculate the complement.

$P(\text{at least one default}) = 1 - P(\text{no defaults})$

### Union of Events

The union $A \cup B$ occurs if **at least one** of $A$ or $B$ occurs.

$$
A \cup B = \{\omega : \omega \in A \text{ or } \omega \in B\}
$$

### Intersection of Events

The intersection $A \cap B$ occurs if **both** $A$ and $B$ occur.

$$
A \cap B = \{\omega : \omega \in A \text{ and } \omega \in B\}
$$

### The Addition Rule

For any two events:
$$
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)
$$

**Why subtract?** Outcomes in both $A$ and $B$ get counted twice if we just add.

**Example:**
- $P(\text{stock A up}) = 0.6$
- $P(\text{stock B up}) = 0.5$
- $P(\text{both up}) = 0.35$

$$
P(\text{at least one up}) = 0.6 + 0.5 - 0.35 = 0.75
$$

### Mutually Exclusive Events

Events $A$ and $B$ are **mutually exclusive** (disjoint) if they cannot both occur:
$$
A \cap B = \emptyset
$$

For mutually exclusive events:
$$
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)
$$

**Example:** A stock cannot simultaneously return exactly +5% and exactly -3%. These are mutually exclusive outcomes.

### Overlapping Events

Events **overlap** when they can both occur:
$$
A \cap B \neq \emptyset
$$

**Example:** "Stock returns positive" and "Stock returns less than 10%" overlap (any return between 0% and 10% satisfies both).

---

## 6. Independence: First Intuition

### What Independence Means

Two events are **independent** if knowing one occurred tells you nothing about whether the other occurred:

$$
P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)
$$

**Intuition:** The probability of both happening equals the product of individual probabilities.

### Independence is Rare in Markets

**A critical warning for quants:** Independence is mathematically convenient but rarely holds in financial markets.

**Why markets aren't independent:**
- Stocks move together (market factor)
- Volatility clusters (GARCH effects)
- Correlations spike during crises
- Momentum and mean-reversion create serial dependence

### Common Independence Mistakes

**Mistake 1:** Assuming daily returns are independent.

Reality: Returns exhibit autocorrelation in volatility (even if not in levels).

**Mistake 2:** Assuming asset returns are independent.

Reality: Correlations are typically positive and increase during stress.

**Mistake 3:** Assuming default events are independent.

Reality: Economic conditions affect multiple firms simultaneously.

### When Independence Approximately Holds

- Returns of unrelated assets over long horizons (weak dependence)
- Idiosyncratic components after factoring out common risks
- Some high-frequency microstructure effects

**Rule of thumb:** Never assume independence without justification. Test for it, or model the dependence explicitly.

## 7. Key Properties Derived from Axioms

From the three axioms, we can prove:

**Empty set:**
$$
P(\emptyset) = 0
$$

**Complement:**
$$
P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)
$$

**Monotonicity:** If $A \subseteq B$, then:
$$
P(A) \leq P(B)
$$

**Bounds:**
$$
0 \leq P(A) \leq 1
$$

**Inclusion-exclusion for three events:**
$$
P(A \cup B \cup C) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) - P(A \cap B) - P(A \cap C) - P(B \cap C) + P(A \cap B \cap C)
$$

## 8. Worked Examples

### Example 1: Portfolio Loss Probability

**Setup:** A portfolio has:
- $P(\text{loss on day 1}) = 0.45$
- $P(\text{loss on day 2}) = 0.45$
- $P(\text{loss on both days}) = 0.25$

**Question:** What's the probability of losing money on at least one day?

**Solution:**
$$
P(\text{loss day 1 or day 2}) = P(D_1) + P(D_2) - P(D_1 \cap D_2)
$$
$$
= 0.45 + 0.45 - 0.25 = 0.65
$$

### Example 2: Multiple Asset Movements

**Setup:** Three stocks with:
- $P(A \text{ up}) = 0.6$, $P(B \text{ up}) = 0.5$, $P(C \text{ up}) = 0.55$
- Assume independence (for illustration)

**Question:** Probability all three go up?

**Solution:** (Using independence)
$$
P(A \cap B \cap C) = P(A) \cdot P(B) \cdot P(C) = 0.6 \times 0.5 \times 0.55 = 0.165
$$

**Question:** Probability at least one goes down?

**Solution:**
$$
P(\text{at least one down}) = 1 - P(\text{all up}) = 1 - 0.165 = 0.835
$$

### Example 3: Complement Trick for Defaults

**Setup:** 10 bonds, each with 2% independent default probability.

**Question:** Probability of at least one default?

**Solution:** Direct calculation is messy. Use complement:
$$
P(\text{at least one default}) = 1 - P(\text{no defaults})
$$
$$
= 1 - (0.98)^{10} = 1 - 0.817 = 0.183
$$

About 18.3% chance of experiencing at least one default.

## 9. Summary

### Key Concepts

**Sample space $\Omega$:** All possible outcomes of a random experiment.

**Event $A$:** A subset of outcomes we care about.

**Probability $P(A)$:** A number in $[0,1]$ satisfying the three axioms.

### Key Formulas

**Complement rule:**
$$
P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)
$$

**Addition rule:**
$$
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)
$$

$$

### Key Insights for Quants

1. **Define your sample space clearly** before assigning probabilities
2. **Probabilities are models**, not predictions of reality
3. **Independence is rare** in financial markets, don't assume it
4. **The complement trick** often simplifies calculations
5. **Overlapping events** require careful counting (subtract the intersection)
