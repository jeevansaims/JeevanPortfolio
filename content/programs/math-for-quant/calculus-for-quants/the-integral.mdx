# The Integral

## 1. Why Integrals Matter in Quant Finance

In quant finance, integrals show up everywhere:

- **Expected return**
- **Option pricing**
- **Present value of cash flows**
- **Probability distributions**
- **Continuous compounding**
- **Risk measures**
- **Monte Carlo estimation**
- **Variance and volatility**

If derivatives measure instantaneous change, integrals measure:

> **total accumulated effect over an interval.**

For quants, integrals allow you to:

- compute continuous cash flows,
- integrate probability densities to get prices,
- measure area under payoff curves,
- calculate expectations,
- approximate prices numerically when closed forms don't exist.

**Integrals are where calculus meets probability — and probability is where quant finance begins.**

## 2. Intuition: The Integral as Accumulation

The integral of a function over an interval measures **accumulated quantity**.

If $f(x)$ represents:

- a rate,
- a density,
- or a value at each point,

then

$$
\int_a^b f(x) \, dx
$$

is the **total amount accumulated** from $x=a$ to $x=b$.

### Examples:

- area under a curve
- total return over time
- total risk exposure
- total probability
- expected payoff

### Area metaphor

Imagine approximating the area under a curve by stacking thin rectangles:

- thinner rectangles → better approximation
- taking the limit gives the exact area

This is the **Riemann integral**.

## 3. The Riemann Integral: Sums Becoming Continuous

Start with a sum:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i) \Delta x.
$$

As $\Delta x \to 0$ and $n \to \infty$, this becomes the integral:

$$
\int_a^b f(x) \, dx = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i) \Delta x.
$$

This connection between sums and integrals is the foundation of:

- Monte Carlo
- numerical integration
- quadrature
- probability theory

Almost all real-world pricing problems ultimately rely on numerically approximating integrals like these.

## 4. Basic Rules of Integration

### Power rule (reverse of differentiation)
$$
\int x^n \, dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C \quad (n \neq -1)
$$

### Exponential rule
$$
\int e^{ax} \, dx = \frac{1}{a}e^{ax} + C.
$$

### Constant multiple rule
$$
\int c \, f(x) \, dx = c \int f(x) \, dx.
$$

### Sum rule
$$
\int (f(x) + g(x)) \, dx = \int f(x) \, dx + \int g(x) \, dx.
$$

### Definite integral and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

If $F'(x) = f(x)$, then

$$
\int_a^b f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a).
$$

This is how integrals are actually computed in practice.

## 5. Quant Application 1: Expected Value of a Return Distribution

Suppose a stock's return $R$ has a probability density function $p(r)$.
The **expected return** is:

$$
E[R] = \int_{-\infty}^\infty r \, p(r) \, dr.
$$

This is foundational:

- every risk measure,
- every pricing model,
- every Monte Carlo simulation,
- every Bayesian model

relies on integrals of this form.

### Example (simple)

Let

$$
p(r) = 2r, \quad 0 \le r \le 1
$$

(a triangular distribution).

Compute expected return:

$$
E[R] = \int_0^1 r(2r) \, dr = 2 \int_0^1 r^2 \, dr.
$$

By power rule:

$$
2 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3}.
$$

## 6. Quant Application 2: Present Value of a Continuous Cash Flow

If $c(t)$ is a cash flow rate at time $t$, then the present value is:

$$
PV = \int_0^T c(t) \, e^{-rt} \, dt.
$$

### Example: Constant flow $c(t) = C$.

$$
PV = \int_0^T C e^{-rt} \, dt.
$$

Use exponential rule:

$$
PV = C \left[-\frac{1}{r}e^{-rt}\right]_0^T = C\left(\frac{1 - e^{-rT}}{r}\right).
$$

This formula is used in:

- bond pricing
- swaps
- forwards
- insurance
- pensions

## 7. Quant Application 3: Option Pricing as an Integral

Under the risk-neutral measure, a European call price can be written as:

$$
C = e^{-rT} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \max(S_T - K, 0) \, f_{S_T}(s) \, ds,
$$

where $f_{S_T}$ is the probability density of the terminal stock price.

This formula:

- shows that option pricing is fundamentally an integral,
- explains why probability theory is essential for quants,
- and highlights the connection between payoffs and distributions.

**Black–Scholes works because you can compute this integral in closed form.**

Most exotic options do NOT have closed-form integrals, so quants approximate them numerically.

## 8. Quant Application 4: Variance and Volatility

Variance is defined as:

$$
\text{Var}(X) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty (x - \mu)^2 p(x) \, dx.
$$

Volatility is the square root.

This integral shows:

- volatility is an average squared deviation,
- weighted by probability density,
- accumulated over all possible outcomes.

This is why volatility is:

- an integral-based statistic,
- deeply tied to probability distributions,
- essential for risk management and pricing models.

## 9. Worked Example: Integrating a Return Curve

Suppose instantaneous return is modeled as:

$$
r(t) = 0.05t.
$$

We want total return from $t=0$ to $t=2$:

$$
\int_0^2 0.05t \, dt = 0.05 \left[\frac{t^2}{2}\right]_0^2.
$$

Compute:

$$
0.05 \cdot \frac{4}{2} = 0.05 \cdot 2 = 0.1.
$$

Total return over this period = **10%**.
