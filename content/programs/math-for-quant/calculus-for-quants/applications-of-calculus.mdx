# Applications of Calculus in Finance

## 1. Why Calculus Matters in Finance

Calculus is the language of change in quantitative finance.

Every core concept in modern finance relies on understanding rates of change and accumulation:

- **Returns** are measured using derivatives of price
- **Continuous compounding** uses limits and exponentials
- **Total growth** is computed by integrating instantaneous returns
- **Volatility** accumulates through integration
- **Interest rates** emerge from derivatives of discount factors
- **Risk metrics** depend on understanding how quantities change

The three foundational ideas from calculus , **limits, derivatives, and integrals** , appear everywhere in quantitative finance.

At its core, calculus in finance answers:

> "How fast is something changing, and what has accumulated over time?"

This lesson connects the abstract calculus you've learned to real concepts used by quants, traders, and financial engineers daily.

## 2. Returns: The Foundation

In finance, we care about **percentage change**, not absolute change.

### Simple Return

If a stock moves from price $P_0$ to $P_1$:

$$
R = \frac{P_1 - P_0}{P_0} = \frac{P_1}{P_0} - 1.
$$

**Interpretation:** The percentage gain or loss.

### Log Return

The **log return** is defined as:

$$
r = \ln\left(\frac{P_1}{P_0}\right) = \ln(P_1) - \ln(P_0).
$$

### Why Log Returns?

Log returns have beautiful mathematical properties:

- **Additive over time**: $r_{\text{total}} = r_1 + r_2 + r_3 + \ldots$
- **Symmetric**: A 10% gain followed by a 10% loss doesn't bring you back to the starting point with simple returns, but log returns handle this correctly
- **Small returns**: For small $R$, $\ln(1+R) \approx R$
- **Continuous models**: Log returns connect directly to continuous-time finance

**Log returns use calculus naturally.**

## 3. Continuous Compounding: Limits in Action

Suppose you invest $P$ dollars at annual interest rate $r$.

If interest compounds $n$ times per year:

$$
A(t) = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}.
$$

What happens as $n \to \infty$? We take the **limit**:

$$
A(t) = P \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} = P e^{rt}.
$$

This is **continuous compounding**.

### The Derivative Connection

The derivative of $A(t) = Pe^{rt}$ with respect to time:

$$
\frac{dA}{dt} = rPe^{rt} = rA(t).
$$

**Interpretation:** The instantaneous rate of change of your investment is proportional to its current value.

This exponential growth model is the foundation for:

- bond pricing
- option pricing
- growth models
- discounting cash flows

**Continuous compounding is calculus applied to money.**

---

## 4. Derivative of Log Price: Instantaneous Return

Let $P(t)$ be the price of an asset at time $t$.

The **derivative of the log price** gives the instantaneous rate of return:

$$
\frac{d}{dt} \ln P(t) = \frac{1}{P(t)} \frac{dP(t)}{dt} = \frac{P'(t)}{P(t)}.
$$

### Why This Matters

- The derivative $P'(t)$ tells you the raw change in price , **not useful** because it depends on the price level
- The derivative $\frac{d}{dt}\ln P(t)$ tells you the **percentage change** , **universally meaningful**

**Finance cares about percentage change, not absolute change.**

### Instantaneous Return

Define the instantaneous return as:

$$
r(t) = \frac{d}{dt} \ln P(t).
$$

This is the continuous analog of discrete log returns.

Every quantitative model of asset prices uses this concept.

---

## 5. Interpreting the Slope of Price

The derivative $P'(t)$ has a simple geometric interpretation:

- **Positive slope** ($P'(t) > 0$): Price is increasing → upward trend
- **Negative slope** ($P'(t) < 0$): Price is decreasing → downward trend
- **Zero slope** ($P'(t) = 0$): Price is flat → potential turning point

### Momentum Interpretation

The magnitude of $P'(t)$ tells you the **velocity** of price movement:

- Large $|P'(t)|$ → rapid price changes
- Small $|P'(t)|$ → slow price changes

Technical analysts and algorithmic traders use derivatives (computed numerically) to identify:

- trend strength
- momentum
- reversal signals

**The slope of the price curve encodes market dynamics.**

---

## 6. Worked Example: Computing Instantaneous Return

Suppose:

$$
P(t) = 100 e^{0.05t}
$$

where $t$ is in years.

**Find the instantaneous return at $t=2$.**

### Solution

First, take the log:

$$
\ln P(t) = \ln(100) + 0.05t.
$$

Now differentiate with respect to time:

$$
\frac{d}{dt} \ln P(t) = 0.05.
$$

**Answer:** The instantaneous return is constant at $r(t) = 5\%$ per year.

This makes sense because the price grows exponentially at rate $5\%$.

---

## 7. Integrals: Accumulated Growth Over Time

If $r(t)$ is the instantaneous return at time $t$, what is the total return over the interval $[0, T]$?

**Use an integral:**

$$
\int_0^T r(t) \, dt = \int_0^T \frac{d}{dt} \ln P(t) \, dt = \ln P(T) - \ln P(0) = \ln\left(\frac{P(T)}{P(0)}\right).
$$

### Interpretation

- The integral gives the **total log return**
- Exponentiate to get the price ratio:

$$
\frac{P(T)}{P(0)} = e^{\int_0^T r(t) \, dt}.
$$

**This is one of the cleanest applications of "integral = accumulation."**

---

## 8. Worked Example: Accumulated Return

Suppose the instantaneous return is constant: $r(t) = 0.08$ (8% per year).

**What is the total return over 5 years?**

### Solution

$$
\int_0^5 0.08 \, dt = 0.08 \times 5 = 0.40.
$$

The total log return is $0.40$.

Convert to a price ratio:

$$
\frac{P(5)}{P(0)} = e^{0.40} \approx 1.4918.
$$

**Interpretation:** The price increased by about 49.18% over 5 years.

If $r(t)$ varies over time, you integrate the function to get the total growth.

---

## 9. Area Under the Return Curve

Think of $r(t)$ as a function plotted over time.

The **area under the curve** from $t=0$ to $t=T$ is:

$$
\text{Area} = \int_0^T r(t) \, dt.
$$

This area represents the **total percentage change** in the asset price.

### Geometric Intuition

- More area above the horizontal axis → more growth
- Area below the horizontal axis → decline
- Net area = net growth

This is how returns accumulate continuously.

**Integral = area = total growth.**

---

## 10. Volatility and Total Variance (Single-Variable Only)

Let $\sigma(t)$ be the volatility (standard deviation of returns) at time $t$.

The **total variance** over the interval $[0, T]$ is:

$$
\text{Total Variance} = \int_0^T \sigma(t)^2 \, dt.
$$

### Why This Matters

- Variance measures uncertainty
- Volatility changes over time (higher during crises, lower during calm periods)
- The integral accumulates uncertainty over time
- This concept appears in:
  - option pricing
  - risk management
  - portfolio construction

### Interpretation

- More "area" under the $\sigma^2$ curve → more total uncertainty
- Implied volatility in options uses an **average** over time

**Volatility accumulates through integration.**

---

## 11. Interest Rates and Discount Factors

A **zero-coupon bond** pays $1$ dollar at maturity $T$.

Its current price is the **discount factor**:

$$
P(t, T) = e^{-r(T-t)}
$$

where $r$ is the continuously compounded interest rate.

### Instantaneous Rate

Take the derivative of the log discount factor:

$$
r(t) = -\frac{d}{dt} \ln P(t).
$$

**Interpretation:** The instantaneous interest rate is the rate at which the discount factor decays.

This connects:

- yield curves
- forward rates
- bond pricing
- discounting future cash flows

All of these use the derivative of the log of the discount factor.

---

## 12. Worked Example: Discount Factor and Interest Rate

Suppose:

$$
P(t) = e^{-0.03t}
$$

where $t$ is time to maturity in years.

**Find the instantaneous interest rate.**

### Solution

Take the log:

$$
\ln P(t) = -0.03t.
$$

Differentiate:

$$
\frac{d}{dt} \ln P(t) = -0.03.
$$

Multiply by $-1$:

$$
r(t) = 0.03.
$$

**Answer:** The instantaneous interest rate is $3\%$ per year.

This is the continuously compounded rate embedded in the discount curve.

## 13. Why Finance Uses Derivatives and Integrals

### Derivatives Answer:

- How fast is something changing?
- What is the instantaneous rate of return?
- What is the slope of the price curve?
- What is the sensitivity to a change in time or rate?

### Integrals Answer:

- What has accumulated over time?
- What is the total return from $t=0$ to $t=T$?
- What is the total variance or uncertainty?
- What is the net effect of continuous compounding?

**Calculus bridges discrete observations to continuous models.**

Every modern quantitative finance framework uses these ideas.

## 14. Summary

- **Returns** are measured as log changes in price.
- **Continuous compounding** uses the limit $\lim_{n \to \infty} (1 + r/n)^n = e^r$.
- The **derivative of log price** gives the instantaneous return: $\frac{d}{dt}\ln P(t)$.
- The **slope of the price curve** tells you momentum and trend direction.
- The **integral of the return** gives total accumulated growth.
- **Total variance** is computed by integrating $\sigma^2(t)$ over time.
- **Interest rates** emerge from the derivative of the log discount factor.

**Calculus is the mathematical foundation of quantitative finance.**

These concepts appear in every model, every pricing formula, and every risk calculation used by quants.
