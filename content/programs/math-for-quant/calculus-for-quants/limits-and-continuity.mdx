# Limits & Continuity

## 1. Why Limits Matter in Quant Finance

Before we touch any formulas, think like a quant:

- You build a pricing model or risk model.
- You change a parameter slightly: volatility, interest rate, spot, correlation.
- Question: **Does your output move in a controlled way, or does it jump, oscillate, or blow up?**

If tiny changes in inputs can cause chaotic jumps in outputs, your model is:

- hard to hedge,
- hard to calibrate,
- and dangerous to trust with real money.

**Limits** are the mathematical tool that let us talk precisely about this idea of *stability as we approach a point*.  
**Continuity** is the property that ensures *no jumps* in that behavior.

This lesson is about building the intuition that:

> Limits → stability  
> Continuity → no jumps  
> Greeks & sensitivities → limits in disguise

## 2. Intuition: What Does “Approach” Mean?

Forget ε–δ for a moment. Think in pictures.

Consider a function $f(x)$. As $x$ gets closer and closer to some value $a$, we watch what $f(x)$ does.

- If the values of $f(x)$ get closer and closer to some number $L$, we say
  $$
  \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L.
  $$
- If they jump around, diverge, or depend on the direction we approach from, the limit fails to exist.

You can think of it numerically: pick a sequence of inputs approaching $a$:

$$
x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots \quad \text{with} \quad x_n \to a
$$

and track:

$$
f(x_1), f(x_2), f(x_3), \dots
$$

If those outputs settle toward a single value $L$, that's the limit.

### Left and right approaches

Sometimes approaching from the left and right matters:

- $x \to a^-$: values of $x$ slightly **less than** $a$
- $x \to a^+$: values of $x$ slightly **greater than** $a$

If

$$
\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = L,
$$

then the two-sided limit exists and equals $L$.
If the two sides disagree, the limit does **not** exist.

In finance, this shows up at **kinks** and **jumps** (for example, at strike $K$ in option payoff functions).

## 3. The Formal ε–δ Definition

Now the rigorous version.

We say

$$
\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L
$$

if and only if:

$$
\forall \varepsilon > 0,\ \exists \delta > 0 \ \text{such that}\ 0 < |x - a| < \delta \implies |f(x) - L| < \varepsilon.
$$

Interpretation:

- $\varepsilon$ (epsilon) is how close you want the **output** $f(x)$ to be to $L$.
- $\delta$ (delta) is how close you must force the **input** $x$ to be to $a$ to guarantee that.

Informally:

> For any output accuracy you demand, there exists some input accuracy that guarantees it.

This is exactly the language of **model stability**:

- If you can always find such a $\delta$, then near $a$, small input changes → controlled output changes.
- If not, your model behaves erratically near $a$.

## 4. Quant Application 1: Stability of an Option Pricing Model

Consider the Black–Scholes price of a European call as a function of volatility $\sigma$:

$$
C(\sigma) = S_0 \Phi(d_1) - K e^{-rT} \Phi(d_2),
$$

where

$$
d_1 = \frac{\ln(S_0 / K) + (r + \sigma^2/2)T}{\sigma \sqrt{T}},
\quad
d_2 = d_1 - \sigma \sqrt{T}.
$$

Here, think of:

- input: $\sigma$ (volatility),
- output: $C(\sigma)$ (option price).

We are interested in:

$$
\lim_{\sigma \to 0} C(\sigma).
$$

Intuition:

- As $\sigma \to 0$, uncertainty disappears.
- The stock either stays almost deterministically near $S_0$, or—under risk-neutral dynamics—follows a nearly deterministic path.
- The option price should converge to its **discounted intrinsic value**:
  - roughly $S_0 - K e^{-rT}$ if clearly in-the-money,
  - or $0$ if clearly out-of-the-money.

We don’t need a full derivation here; the key is the mindset:

- We are using a **limit** to ask:  
  *What does my pricing model say in the extreme regime where volatility is nearly zero?*

If this convergence is smooth and well-behaved, the model is **stable** near low volatility.
If instead tiny changes in $\sigma$ caused huge jumps in $C(\sigma)$, hedging with respect to volatility would be chaotic.

## 5. Limits and Greeks: Sensitivities as Limits

Greeks are essentially **limits of finite differences**.

For example, the Delta of a call with respect to $S_0$:

$$
\Delta = \frac{\partial C}{\partial S_0} \approx \frac{C(S_0 + h) - C(S_0)}{h}
$$

for small $h$.
Formally:

$$
\Delta = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{C(S_0 + h) - C(S_0)}{h}.
$$

This is exactly a **limit definition** of a derivative.

If this limit exists and behaves nicely:

- Delta is well-defined and stable.
- Small changes in spot price lead to predictable changes in option price.
- Hedging by adjusting positions in the underlying actually makes sense.

If this limit does **not** exist or oscillates wildly:

- Delta is ill-defined.
- Numerical estimations of Delta can be extremely noisy.
- Risk management becomes unreliable.

The same idea applies to Gamma, Vega, Rho, etc.:

- All are limits of how the price responds as some parameter changes.
- Good models have well-behaved limits (smooth sensitivities).

## 6. Discontinuities in Finance

Not all financial functions are continuous. Some have **built-in jumps or kinks**, and that matters.

Examples:

1. **Vanilla call payoff**
   $$
   f(S_T) = \max(S_T - K, 0)
   $$
   - Continuous in $S_T$ (no jump),
   - but has a **kink** at $S_T = K$: left and right derivatives differ.

2. **Digital (binary) option payoff**
   $$
   f(S_T) =
   \begin{cases}
   1, & S_T \ge K, \\
   0, & S_T < K.
   \end{cases}
   $$
   - Not continuous at $S_T = K$: there is an actual jump.
   - This causes very sharp sensitivities near the strike.

3. **Credit events / default**  
   - The value of a bond or CDS can jump when a credit event happens.
   - Mathematically: a discontinuity in the price process.

4. **Dividends and price gaps**  
   - Ex-dividend date: price drops discretely by roughly the dividend amount.
   - Market crashes: prices gap down, not a smooth path.

Why this matters:

- Discontinuities and kinks create **limit issues** (left/right limits, infinite or undefined derivatives).
- Numerical schemes (finite differences, PDE solvers, Monte Carlo Greeks) must respect these features.
- As a quant, you must be aware when your payoff or model is continuous vs discontinuous.

## 7. Continuity: "No Jumps" in the Output

Formally, a function $f$ is **continuous** at a point $a$ if:

1. $f(a)$ is defined,
2. $\lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ exists,
3. and
   $$
   \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a).
   $$

Intuition for models:

- Continuity at $a$ means **no surprise jumps** in the output when you are around $a$.
- If your pricing function is continuous in $S_0, \sigma, r, T$, then small perturbations in these inputs will not cause sudden output jumps.

For most **closed-form pricing formulas** (e.g. Black–Scholes under typical assumptions):

- The mapping from parameters to price is continuous.
- This is part of what makes them comfortable to use: they behave smoothly when you tweak inputs.

But as you saw above, payoffs and some real-world phenomena can introduce kinks or jumps.  
In those cases, the underlying pricing model must carefully handle **limits from the left and right** and potentially **discontinuous behavior**.

---

## 8. Worked Example: Limit as Volatility → 0

Return to the question:

> What happens to the Black–Scholes call price $C(\sigma)$ as $\sigma \to 0$?

High-level reasoning:

- With $\sigma \approx 0$, the randomness in the underlying is almost gone.
- Under the risk-neutral measure, $S_T$ behaves almost like a deterministic quantity (driven mostly by drift).
- The option will almost surely either:
  - end in-the-money with a payoff close to $S_0 e^{rT} - K$,
  - or out-of-the-money with payoff close to $0$,
  - depending on the relationship between current spot and strike.

In a simple intuition:

- If the option is clearly in-the-money already and nothing "random" can change that, the price converges to roughly its discounted intrinsic value $S_0 - K e^{-rT}$.
- If it's clearly out-of-the-money, the price converges toward $0$.

The point isn’t the exact closed-form limit here. The point is:

- You are using a **limit** to probe an **extreme regime** of the model.
- You are checking that the model’s behavior **matches your financial intuition** in that regime.

Whenever you take a limit of your pricing or risk function as some parameter (vol, maturity, correlation, etc.) goes to an extreme value, you’re doing this kind of sanity check.

### Mini Example: What Delta Represents

Delta measures how sensitive the option price is to small changes in the underlying price:

$$
\Delta = \frac{\partial C}{\partial S_0}.
$$

Intuition:

- If a call is **deep in-the-money**, its payoff behaves almost like $S_T - K$, so the price moves almost one-to-one with the spot price. In that regime, $\Delta \approx 1$.
- If a call is **deep out-of-the-money**, its payoff is almost always $0$, so small changes in $S_0$ barely affect the price. In that regime, $\Delta \approx 0$.

As volatility $\sigma \to 0$ in the in-the-money case, uncertainty disappears and the option behaves almost like a deterministic forward contract. In that limit, the call price moves almost one-to-one with $S_0$, so

$$
\lim_{\sigma \to 0} \Delta_{\text{call}} = 1 \quad \text{if } S_0 > K.
$$

This is exactly the kind of limit intuition we use when we talk about model sensitivities and hedging.

### Call Payoff: Continuous but Not Smooth

For a vanilla call option, the payoff is

$$
f(S_T) = \max(S_T - K, 0).
$$

This function is **continuous** at the strike $S_T = K$:

- As $S_T \to K^-$, the payoff approaches $0$.
- As $S_T \to K^+$, the payoff also approaches $0$.

So the left and right limits agree and equal the value at the point:

$$
\lim_{S_T \to K^-} f(S_T)
=
\lim_{S_T \to K^+} f(S_T)
= 0 = f(K).
$$

There is no jump, so the payoff is continuous.  
However, the **slope** changes abruptly: it is $0$ for $S_T < K$ and $1$ for $S_T > K$. That kink means the derivative does **not** exist at $S_T = K$, which is important when thinking about Greeks and numerical methods.


## 9. Summary

- Limits capture how a function behaves **as inputs approach** a value, not just at the value.
- The formal ε–δ definition encodes **stability**: for every desired output precision, you can enforce a suitable input precision.
- In quant finance, limits are everywhere:
  - in **stability of pricing models**,
  - in **sensitivities (Greeks)**,
  - and in **extreme-parameter sanity checks**.
- Continuity means **no jumps**: the limit as you approach a point equals the function’s value there.
- Many financial objects are continuous (pricing formulas), but some key ones have **kinks** or **jumps** (payoffs, defaults, digital options), which create special behavior of limits and derivatives.
- Thinking in terms of limits and continuity trains you to ask:
  > “If I nudge this parameter, does the model respond smoothly, or does it misbehave?”

This mindset is exactly what you need before we move on to derivatives, integrals, and optimization in the next lessons.
