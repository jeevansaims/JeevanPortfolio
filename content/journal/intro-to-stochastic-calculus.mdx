# Introduction to Stochastic Calculus for Quants

## Why Stochastic Calculus Matters

If you want to work in quantitative finance, you need stochastic calculus. It's not optional. Every pricing model, every risk calculation, every trading strategy in derivatives markets builds on this foundation.

But here's the good news: **the intuition behind stochastic calculus is more important than the technical proofs**. In this post, I'll give you the practical understanding you need to start using these tools.

## The Problem: Modeling Randomness

Standard calculus works beautifully for deterministic systems. But financial markets aren't deterministic—they're **random**. Stock prices jump around, interest rates fluctuate, volatility changes.

We need calculus that handles randomness. That's stochastic calculus.

## Brownian Motion: The Building Block

Everything in stochastic calculus starts with **Brownian motion** (also called a Wiener process), denoted $W_t$.

### Key Properties

1. **Continuous paths** - The process never jumps
2. **Independent increments** - What happens in one time interval is independent of other intervals
3. **Normal increments** - $W_t - W_s \sim N(0, t-s)$ for $t > s$
4. **Starts at zero** - $W_0 = 0$

Think of Brownian motion as the **pure essence of randomness** in continuous time.

## Geometric Brownian Motion

In finance, we typically model stock prices using **geometric Brownian motion** (GBM):

$$
dS_t = \mu S_t dt + \sigma S_t dW_t
$$

This says: *the change in stock price has a drift term ($\mu S_t dt$) and a random term ($\sigma S_t dW_t$)*.

### Why This Model?

1. **Prices stay positive** - Unlike arithmetic Brownian motion
2. **Percentage returns are normal** - Log returns are normally distributed
3. **Multiplicative growth** - Returns compound naturally

The solution to this SDE is:

$$
S_t = S_0 \exp\left[\left(\mu - \frac{\sigma^2}{2}\right)t + \sigma W_t\right]
$$

## Itô's Lemma: The Chain Rule on Steroids

If you remember one thing from stochastic calculus, make it **Itô's Lemma**. It's the chain rule for stochastic processes.

For a function $f(t, S_t)$ where $S_t$ follows:

$$
dS_t = \mu(S_t, t)dt + \sigma(S_t, t)dW_t
$$

Itô's Lemma tells us:

$$
df = \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + \mu\frac{\partial f}{\partial S} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial S^2}\right)dt + \sigma\frac{\partial f}{\partial S}dW_t
$$

### The Key Difference

Notice that extra term: $\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial S^2}$

This appears because in stochastic calculus, $(dW_t)^2 = dt$. This is profoundly different from ordinary calculus where $(dx)^2 \approx 0$.

## Practical Example: Deriving Black-Scholes

Let's use Itô's Lemma to understand the Black-Scholes PDE.

Suppose we have a European call option $V(S_t, t)$. If $S_t$ follows GBM:

$$
dS_t = \mu S_t dt + \sigma S_t dW_t
$$

Then by Itô's Lemma:

$$
dV = \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + \mu S\frac{\partial V}{\partial S} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 S^2\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2}\right)dt + \sigma S\frac{\partial V}{\partial S}dW_t
$$

Now comes the magic: **we can hedge away the randomness**.

If we form a portfolio $\Pi = V - \Delta S$ where $\Delta = \frac{\partial V}{\partial S}$, the random terms cancel out!

Since this portfolio is risk-free, it must earn the risk-free rate:

$$
d\Pi = r\Pi dt
$$

After some algebra, this gives us the Black-Scholes PDE:

$$
\frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 S^2\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2} + rS\frac{\partial V}{\partial S} - rV = 0
$$

**This is Itô's Lemma in action.**

## The Feynman-Kac Connection

Here's another powerful result: **PDEs and expectations are connected**.

The Feynman-Kac theorem tells us that solving a PDE is equivalent to computing an expectation under the right probability measure.

For Black-Scholes, this means:

$$
V(S_t, t) = e^{-r(T-t)}\mathbb{E}^{\mathbb{Q}}[\text{Payoff}(S_T) | S_t]
$$

Where $\mathbb{Q}$ is the **risk-neutral measure**.

This is huge: instead of solving PDEs, we can use Monte Carlo simulation!

## Practical Tips for Learning

1. **Focus on intuition first** - Don't get lost in measure theory
2. **Practice with examples** - Work through GBM, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, etc.
3. **Connect to applications** - Always ask "how does this help me price or hedge?"
4. **Master Itô's Lemma** - It's the workhorse of quant finance

## Common Stochastic Processes in Finance

### Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process

Mean-reverting process used for interest rates and volatility:

$$
dX_t = \theta(\mu - X_t)dt + \sigma dW_t
$$

### CIR Process

Used for interest rate modeling (stays positive):

$$
dr_t = \theta(\mu - r_t)dt + \sigma\sqrt{r_t}dW_t
$$

### Heston Model

Stochastic volatility model:

$$
dS_t = \mu S_t dt + \sqrt{v_t} S_t dW_t^S
$$

$$
dv_t = \kappa(\theta - v_t)dt + \xi\sqrt{v_t}dW_t^v
$$

## Moving Forward

Stochastic calculus is a journey, not a destination. Start with:

1. **Brownian motion** - Understand it deeply
2. **Itô's Lemma** - Practice until it's second nature
3. **Simple SDEs** - Solve GBM, OU process by hand
4. **Risk-neutral pricing** - Grasp the intuition

In upcoming posts, we'll dive deeper into **Girsanov's theorem**, **martingale pricing**, and **numerical methods for SDEs**.

The mathematics can seem abstract, but remember: **every formula represents a hedging strategy or a trading insight**.
